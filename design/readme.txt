Sample Table Definitions:
(See [CreateTable2.sql] for full schema)

sql

CREATE TABLE Users (
  userid INT AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  passwordhash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  firstname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  rollnumber VARCHAR(20),
  phonenumber VARCHAR(15),
  hostelname VARCHAR(50),
  hostelblock VARCHAR(5),
  roomnumber VARCHAR(10),
  profilepictureurl VARCHAR(255),
  registrationdate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  accountstatus ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'suspended') DEFAULT 'active'
);

CREATE TABLE Items (
  itemid INT AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  ownerid INT NOT NULL,
  categoryid INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  rentalprice DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  rentalunit ENUM('hour', 'day', 'week', 'month') NOT NULL,
  itemcondition ENUM('new', 'like new', 'good', 'fair') NOT NULL,
  availabilitystatus ENUM('available', 'rented', 'unavailable') DEFAULT 'available',
  locationdescription VARCHAR(255),
  dateadded TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  maxrentalduration INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (ownerid) REFERENCES Users(userid) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (categoryid) REFERENCES Categories(categoryid) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
Other tables (ItemImages, Rentals, Notifications, WishlistItems) are similarly normalized and use foreign keys for data integrity.

4. Core Backend Procedures
The backend uses parameterized stored procedures for all critical workflows:

User Management

RegisterUser, AuthenticateUser, UpdateUserProfile, ChangePassword, GetUserProfile

Item Management

ListItem, UpdateItemDetails, UpdateItemAvailability, AddItemImage, DeleteItem, GetItemDetails

Browsing & Wishlist

GetItemsByCategory, SearchItems, AddToWishlist, RemoveFromWishlist, GetUserWishlist

Rental Management

RequestRental, UpdateRentalStatus, GetUserRentals

Notification Management

CreateNotification, GetUserNotifications

All procedures are designed for security, transactional consistency, and error handling.

5. Sample Data
The platform is pre-populated with realistic data for testing and demonstration:

Users: 20+ users with campus-specific details (name, roll, hostel, etc.)

Categories: 20+ categories (Electronics, Books, Cycles, etc.)

Items: 20+ items (calculators, cycles, headphones, textbooks, etc.), each with owner, category, images, and detailed descriptions.

Rentals: Multiple rental records across all statuses (requested, confirmed, active, completed, cancelled, rejected).

Notifications: For rental confirmations, reminders, completions, cancellations, and requests.

Wishlist: Users have wishlisted a variety of items, with uniqueness enforced per user-item pair.
